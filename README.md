The personal finance Power BI dashboard  provides a holistic view of the financial status. The dashboard includes key visualizations such as income and expense breakdowns, and an available balance card that gives  real-time information about  card balances. Additionally, there's a sparkline curve that tracks  high and low income and expense months over time, helping to identify trends. A tile slicer allows  to easily select specific months for analysis, while a gauge chart visually compares  targeted income against  total income.  Also filter the income sources using both side and main income slicers. Lastly, the dashboard features alerts that notify  about  monthly and total debt obligations, ensuring to stay on top of  financial goals.
